why i got AA????

I started from zero background in Networking and distributed with the given assignment and instruction.i followed guideline given by the instructor and completed all assignment within given time. i gave my 100% for this course.I took this course to learn and build something and that was the point which attracted me toward this course but that required honest attempt to complete all task and I did that. That's the main reason i got AA.I did my assignment on time,Followed the instruction seriously,Followed the guideline given by the instructor.
    The course tought me a lot of thing that starts from a from a new language to different approaches to handle real life problem and i enjoyed everything... may be that's why i got AA because the course was not a burden for me it was a like a  workshop or a certificate course to learn things that is more close to real life technologies .... just not to pass the a course for credit and grads
